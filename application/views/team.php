                    <p>As of 2010, our baseball team "Dragons" has shown outstanding demonstrations both in and out of field. In the field, members believe in the companionship
we has created. It is what links us together, allows to overcome strenuous weekly base practices, and leads us to achieve our goal. At the outfield, 
members believe in each indivisuals. Beyond teammates, we are brothers, friends, and family. Baseball must be entertaining, and that is what we play. </p>

                    <p> We feel what I almost always feel when playing a ballgame: Just for those two or three hours, there is really no place I would rather be.
    We want to savor every minute of it. That is what baseball mean to us.</p>
